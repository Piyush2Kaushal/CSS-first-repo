# CSS Animation, Transition, and Transformation Playground
<br>
Welcome to my CSS animation, transition, and transformation playground! In this repository, I've explored various techniques and properties of CSS to create engaging and interactive web elements.
<br>
## What I Learned
<br>
I thoroughly enjoyed learning about CSS animation, transition, and transformation. Here are some key concepts I've explored:
<br>
1 -- CSS Animation**: I learned how to create smooth animations using `@keyframes` and the `animation` property. From simple movement effects to more complex transformations, I've experimented with a variety of animation techniques.
<br>
2 -- CSS Transition**: Transitioning between CSS property values can add elegance and interactivity to a webpage. I've learned how to use the `transition` property to smoothly animate changes in properties such as color, size, and position.
<br>
3 -- CSS Transformation**: CSS transformations allow for the manipulation of elements in 2D and 3D space. I've explored transformations such as translation, rotation, scaling, and skewing to create visually stunning effects.
